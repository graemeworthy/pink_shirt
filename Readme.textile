h1. Pink Shirt

 *wash out all that RedCloth* 

h2. It reverses the HTML back into textile

h2. Usage

bc. text =  "This is *my* text."
html = RedCloth.new(text).to_html
same = PinkShirt.new(html).to_textile
same #=> "This is *my* text."

h2. Motivation

I had a problem: some html needed to be textile

None of the available options could get back to exactly where you started.
They weren't 'reversable'.

I learned a lot by reading other's who went before.
I've looked at: "html2texile":https://github.com/thickpaddy/html2textile
I've looked at: "clothred":https://github.com/CynicalRyan/ClothRed
I've looked at: "a deeply buried module in humpyard":https://github.com/humpyard/humpyard

This library still has some problems with whitespace management, but the majority of the the tags convert.

It's based around "textile-spec":https://github.com/textile/textile-spec
and built to produce mirror images of html produced by
"RedCloth":https://github.com/jgarber/redcloth
